**Welcome!**

## Getting Started

üßë‚ÄçüöÄ

- **Always break lines!** Set your editor to show a ruler at ~80 characters. This is done so that people who are reading this as a raw file don't have to scroll infinitely.

  This is not a hard and fast rule though. Also, you don't have to break a line for that one last word which overflows (except if it is "Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis" or something ü§£).

- **Minimise HTML.** Keep your markdown file as much markdown-y as possible ‚Äì you don't want people reading HTML! Only use HTML if it is really helpful to the readability of the rendered content. A good example of when to use an HTML tag is the `<details>` tag.

- **Use reference-style links** because you don't want a super long link to break the flow.
