## Workflow

The claim starts when the adjuster calls in and submits a claim with a representative over the web portal. With all the necessary information (Claim Information, Service Type, Adjuster's Contact Information, and Billing Information).

Once the claim has been submitted with the assistance of the customer service representative, the claim is then pushed to Exemplar.

Customer support is part of the customer service department. The customer service representatives are required to make outbound calls to insureds on behalf of the insurance carriers, to schedule unaccompanied field inspections.
