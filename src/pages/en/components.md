Components in this dir will be auto-registered and on-demand, powered by [`unplugin-vue-components`](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-vue-components).

### Icons

You can use icons from almost any icon sets by the power of [Iconify](https://iconify.design/).

It will only bundle the icons you use. Check out [`unplugin-icons`](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-icons) for more details.


## Badge

Badge is a decorative indicator used to either call attention to a related item
or for communicating non-actionable, supplemental information. The Box component
is a low-level primitive used for layout purposes. It can be used to create grid
layouts, apply padding or margin, and more. Button is used to trigger actions
based on a user's interaction.
